Doom Au Louvre (En: Doom At the Louvre), for short "DAL" is a Python project by a team of 3:
  Maé Picard (lead programmer and game-designer)
    Nolan Guthinger (artist, game-designer, lever maker)
      Nathan Bruyère (programmmer, technical writer)

Our game is a Doom-like FPS (First Person Shooter) graphically inspired by the first Doom game.
In it, you control an anonyme caracter with two possible guns, trying to escape from demons.
Either you play in a randomly generated infinite perfect maze, or in designed levels;
in both cases, their are breakable or unbreakable walls, different demons, and items on the floor to help you.

You can walk, run, dash, jump or shoot in the air to gain more speed;
your gun can zoom to scope, shoot and break or kill, it has a flashlight integreted to let you see;
and the demons are running after you.
